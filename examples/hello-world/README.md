# Hello, world!

This function writes hello world to stdout and exists.
You can find it in the cloud watch logs after you've
invoked the function, which you can do from any HTTP client – indeed, any browser.

This is not enough to make the lambda machine happy –
it will report an error to your browser – but it is
enough for proof of life.
